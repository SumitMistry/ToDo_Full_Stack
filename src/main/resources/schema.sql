--- schema.sql: Spring Boot provides a mechanism to customize the database schema generation process.
--- If you want to override the default schema generation strategy or include additional SQL statements,
--- you can create a file named schema.sql in the src/main/resources directory of your project.
--- The SQL statements in this file will be executed after Hibernate's auto-generated schema creation.*
--- So, in summary, the schema.sql file is not automatically generated by Spring Boot itself;
--- rather, it's a place where you can provide custom SQL DDL statements to supplement or override the schema generated by Hibernate.
--- If you don't provide a schema.sql file, Spring Boot will still generate the necessary schema based on your entity classes.
---  if I write here anything it will automatically get executed...
--- if I keep this "update" this file will automatically created
--- spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
